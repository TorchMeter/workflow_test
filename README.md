> 💡 Tips      
> • We use [`setup.cfg`](setup.cfg) to manage all metadata, and just keep a minimal [`setup.py`](setup.py) to ensure editable installation supported. 

We provide:

1. **A fully configured package-setup file**, i.e., [`setup.cfg`](setup.cfg) or [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/Ahzyuan/Python-package-template/releases/download/v1.4.0/pyproject.toml).
   - It covers most common config items, allows dynamic access to `version`, `README`, and project dependencies when building.
   - It is well commented, so you don't need to look up [documents](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/references/keywords.html) to understand each item's meaning.

2. **A complete and concise usage guidance**, i.e. the [`🔨 Usage`](#-usage) section below.      

3. **CI/CD support**: Once a **push with a tag** is made and the **tag matches a template** of the form `v*.*.*`, the CI/CD pipeline will be triggered to build the package, upload it to `PyPI` and `TestPyPI` and create a release in your github project according to tag name and `CHANGELOG.md`. See the [`CI/CD via Github Action 🤖`](#-project-management) section below.

<summary>𝐄𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐟𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥</summary>

We provide a **useful, complete project structure**, which    
• not only complies with software engineering specifications,    
• but also includes **all file templates** required for a project and **continuous deployment(CD) workflows**(see the [`CI/CD via Github Action 🤖`](#-project-management) section below).

Here is the detailed structure of the project:

- **We standardize code sytle and quality** with the wonderful Python linter and formatter: [`Ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).
- **We standardize contributing pipeline** with [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to cut communication costs and boost development efficiency.
- **We offer ready-to-use templates** for `issue`, `pull requests(PR)`, and package publishing workflows, complete with modifications and usage instructions to help you customize them effectively.

## 🔨 Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]   
> - In demo below, we assume that your github ID is `me` and project name is `my-project`.         
>   **❗️❗️❗️ Remember to replace them with your own ID and project name when using ❗️❗️❗️**
>
> - This template uses `setup.cfg` to manage all metadata by default. While `pyproject.toml` is an officially recommended alternative, I find it more complicated, so I prefer `setup.cfg`. But if you really want to use `pyproject.toml`, please **replace the `setup.cfg` with `pyproject.toml` below**. Of course, you can download it directly [here](https://github.com/Ahzyuan/Python-package-template/releases/download/v1.4.0/pyproject.toml).

    > 💡 Tips  
    > 
    > • If your `README` is in `rst` format, you need to replace `"text/markdown"` with  `"text/x-rst"` in `long_description_content_type`(`setup.cfg`) or `readme`(`pyproject.toml`).  
    > 
    > • If you want to create a CLI command for your package, enable `[options.entry_points]` option in `setup.cfg` or `[project.gui-scripts]` in `pyproject.toml`. See more [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/creating-command-line-tools/).
    > 
    > • If you want more configuration, refer to [keywords of `setup.cfg`](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/references/keywords.html) or [keywords of `pyproject.toml`](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html)

    **Look for the following variables in `setup.cfg` and modify as per comments.**

    |       Basic        |    Requirement related     | Package structure related |
    |:------------------:|:--------------------------:|:-------------------------:|

    > 💡 Tips    
    > • Cross-module imports can be made via `.module-name` or `my-project.module-name` in each module file.  
    > 
    > • You can test your code using `python -m my-project.<module-name>` with working directory in `MYPROJECT`.   
    > 
    > • To develop a command-line tool, add `__main__.py` in `my-project` folder. It defines logit when typing `my-project` in terminal. See more [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/creating-command-line-tools/)

    **Fill your logit into `my-project` folder**.

    > You likely have many commits to `PyPI` or `TestPyPI` to familiarize yourself with the publishing operation. In this case, you can maintain a **forged `PyPI` server locally**, see the [`🧰 Tools Recommended -> pypi-server`](#-tools-recommended) section below.

    ```bash
    # pwd: .../MYPROJECT

    # (Option but strongly recommended) upload to testpypi firstly to see if anywhere wrong
    twine upload --repository testpypi dist/* 

    # upload to pypi

    After executing command above, you will be asked to **enter your account token**.  

    - Sure, you can paste your token in terminal to go through the process.   
    
    - But if you are tired of doing this, you can use `.pypirc` and `keyring` to automatically access your token whenever needed. Follow the step in the [`configure .pypirc and keyring 🔐`](#-tools-recommended) section below.

> • **What is it**: A simple `PyPI` server for local use.   
> • **Highly recommended** if you are **testing your CI/CD workflow**.

You likely have many commits to `PyPI` or `TestPyPI` to familiarize yourself with publishing process. Then there exists two problems:
  
> • [`TestPyPI` / `PyPI` project size limit](https://pypi.org/help/#project-size-limit): many commits can exceed project size limit.    
> 
> • Using `TestPyPI` as the index of `pip install` is not always reliable:  especially when your package depends on some packages that are only available on `PyPI` but not on `TestPyPI`.   
> >For example, if your package `mp-project` depends on `ruff`, then `pip install mp-project -i https://test.pypi.org/simple` will fail with `ResolutionImpossible` or `Package not found` in the process of finding and downloading `ruff`, cause `ruff` is only available on `PyPI`.

To solve these problems and fully imitate the bahvior of normal `pip install` using `PyPI` index. You can deploy a local `PyPI` server with `pypi-server`.

Here is a quick guide to get started, please check [pypiserver's repo](https://github.com/pypiserver/pypiserver ) for more details.


```bash
pip install pypiserver 

mkdir Path/to/store/packages  # path to store distribution packages

pypi-server run \
-i 0.0.0.0 \
-p <port> \                  # specify a port to listen
<path-to-store>/.pypiserver_pkgs\
-a . -P . &                  # disable authentication for intranet use

cat >~/.pypirc<<EOF          # add local server to .pypirc
[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi
    testpypi
    local

[pypi]
repository: https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/

[testpypi]
repository: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/

[local]
    repository: http://0.0.0.0:7418
    username: none          # random string, not important
    password: none          # random string, not important
EOF
```

OK, then we can use commands below to upload and install packages:

```bash
# pwd: .../package project dir

# upload package to local server
twine upload --repository local dist/*

# install package from local server
pip install <package> \
--trusted-host \
--extra-index-url http://0.0.0.0:<port>/simple/ 
```

❗️❗️❗️ If you want to close the server, using `kill -9 "$(pgrep pypi-server)"`.

1. Configure `keyring` first

    ```bash
    pip install keyring keyrings.alt

    # if you are on Linux, execute commands below additionally.
    cat >"$(keyring diagnose | grep "config path:" | cut -d' ' -f3)"<<EOF
    [backend]
    default-keyring=keyrings.alt.file.PlaintextKeyring
    EOF

    # encrypt your pypi token 
    ## pypi
    keyring set https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ __token__

    ## enter your pypi token when prompted

    # verify that the encrypted token has been stored
    keyring get https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ __token__ 

    # ------------------------ same for testpypi ------------------------

    ## testpypi
    keyring set https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ __token__

    ## enter your pypi token when prompted

    # verify that the encrypted token has been stored
    keyring get https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ __token__
    ```

2. Configure `.pypirc`

    ```bash
    # refer to https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pypirc/
    cat >~/.pypirc<<EOF
    [distutils]
    index-servers =
        pypi
        testpypi

    [pypi]
    repository = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/

    [testpypi]
    repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
    EOF

    chmod 600 ~/.pypirc
    ```

3. At this point, there is **no need** to verify your token manually when you upload packages via `twine upload`

<summary>Ⅰ 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 💼</summary>

Standardizing project participation cuts communication costs and boosts development efficiency. This mainly focus on the files below: 

1. [`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) : guide other to make contribution to your project. To change it, refer to [link](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors).

2. [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) : standardize the format of `issue` reporting. Composed of

    - [`bug_report.yml`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml): template for reporting bugs.
    - [`feature_request.yml`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml): template for requesting new features.
    - [`config.yml`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml): A selector for templates that restricts issue initiation without templates.
    
    > 💡 Tips     
    > • Open the [`Issue page`](https://github.com/Ahzyuan/Python-package-template/issues/new/choose) in this repo,to see what the template looks like.      
    > • If you are to change it, refer to [link1](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository), [link2](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms) and [link3](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-githubs-form-schema).
   
3. [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) : standardize the format of `Pull Request`. To change it, refer to [link](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository).

> ⚠️⚠️⚠️     
> • Due to the need of publishing to PyPI and TestPypi, **trusted publishers of  two platform needs to be configured first before use**. Following [tutorial 1](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/#configuring-trusted-publishing) and [tutorial 2](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/creating-a-project-through-oidc/#github-actions) to make it.       
> 
> • **NOTE**: The `Environment name` item in configuration should be the same as what you specify in the workflow file.
> > For example, in the provided [publish_release.yml](.github/workflows/publish_release.yml), the `Environment name` is `pypi` in PyPI platform, cause we specify it in job `Publish-PyPI.environment.name`.

- By creating a `.yml` file under the `.github/workflows/` directory, CI/CD support for the project can be achieved.

- In this template repo, the automation of **steps 6 to 8** in `🔨 Usage` section is implemented. Once a **push with a tag** is made and the **tag matches a template** of the form `v*.*.*`, events below will happen:
  1. Build distribution packages, i.e., `.tar.gz` and `.whl` files
  2. Verify meta information of the distribution packages
  3. Release distribution packages to `PyPI` and `TestPyPI`, respectively
  4. Generate release according to tag name and `CHANGELOG.md`
  5. Upload the distribution package to the generated release.

- If you are to change the task flows, please see [Github Actions document](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for more details.
  
> ❗️❗️❗️      
> If you want to disable the CI/CD feature, there are two options:           
> • delete the `.github/workflows/` directory        
> • do `Settings -> Actions -> General -> Disable actions` in project setting.
